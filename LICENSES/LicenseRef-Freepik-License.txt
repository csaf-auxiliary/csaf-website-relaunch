8.1. General
The Company authorizes the User to download and use the Freepik Content under
the terms of this Section (see Section 7 in relation to Sponsored Content). The
Company and its licensors reserve all rights over the Freepik Content not
expressly granted in this license to the User.

Subject to the fulfillment of these Terms, the Company authorizes the User in a
non-transferable, revocable, limited, non-exclusive manner and on a worldwide
basis for the duration of the relevant rights; to download, use and modify the
Freepik Content, in a device the User owns or controls and only for the
purposes and uses allowed in these Terms.

The User may use the Freepik Content (including any derivative work), either
using the Freepik Contents in its entirety or using only some or some of its
elements, either using the Freepik Contents without modification, combining
them with other contents or having previously modified them, being the license
granted with respect to the Freepik content, provided that it:

Does not involve collective use;
The Freepik Content is not used in a manner that suggests an association or
endorsement of any kind by the Company or the Website;
The Freepik Content or any derivative work is not used or included (in whole or
in part) in a database, archive or in any other media/stock product,
collection, set of clips, or library, for distribution or resale or used in any
other way that could prevent or limit future visits or downloads from the
Website;
Does not resell, assign, transfer or sublicense the Freepik Content or any
derived work from the Freepik Content;
Does not use the Freepik Content in printed or electronic items (e.g. t-shirts,
cups, postcards, birthday or greeting cards, invitations, calendars, web models
or electronic devices, apps, NFTs, videogames, advertising spots, audiovisual
animations) aimed to be resold, in which the Freepik Content is the main
element (because of size, relevance or any other cause, in case of doubt about
whether the content is main element, it shall be deemed that the content is
main element);
Does not use the Freepik Content (totally or partially) in any trademark, or
part of the same, which may be used by any other means to guarantee or to imply
a guaranty of any product and/or service, unless the Freepik Content used in
such cases is modified in such a way as to be a new and different content not
confusingly similar with the original Freepik Content or implies a use of the
Freepik Content as a template or test, and not as a final item or material;
Does not use the Freepik Content (including any caption information, title,
keywords or other metadata associated with the Freepik Content) for any machine
learning and/or artificial intelligence purposes, or for any technologies
designed or intended for the identification of natural persons.
Does not make any use of the Freepik Content which might be considered
defamatory, libellous, obscene, immoral or illegal, including, without
limitation, using it in a way that places any person appearing in the Freepik
Content in a negative light or depicts them in a way that they may find
offensive such as the use in pornography, advertisements for escort or similar
services, political endorsements, birth control products, and;
Does not make any use of the Freepik Content to slander, libel or to vilify a
person, race, sex, culture, sexual orientation, religion, country, region,
town, village or any other place, or any other human group.
When any Freepik Content is marked or identified as for editorial use, or when
within the same there are logos, recognizable products, public buildings,
public events or images taken in places where recognizable persons appear in
the background, the User shall only be entitled to use it for such editorial
use. In such cases, the User undertakes not to use that content in any manner
that entails any connection with any business activity, the use in economic
traffic or advertising, marketing or commercialization of any product or
service. The User shall be directly liable and the Company shall not assume any
liability as a result of the use for commercial purposes by the User of any
content belonging to the Freepik Content, which according to this paragraph
should be for editorial use only.

The User acknowledges that some laws may impose limits on the use of Freepik
Content. For this reason, the User agrees that it is the User's responsibility,
and not the Company's, to verify that the applicable regulations in the User's
jurisdiction do not prohibit the User's use of the Freepik Content.

Unless otherwise indicated, authorization to use Freepik Content is free of
charge and conditioned upon any use by the User being duly attributed to the
Website/Company and, where applicable, to the Collaborator, as indicated by the
Company at any given time. To benefit from the Service of using Freepik Content
without the aforementioned attribution, the User must purchase a Premium or
Premium+ Subscription on the Website and download the corresponding Freepik
Content during the validity of that Subscription. The conditions established in
Clause 9 of these Terms apply to the acquisition of different Subscriptions.

As a general rule, it is forbidden for a User to authorize any third parties to
use the Freepik Content (or any modification of any Freepik Content). As an
exception to the prohibition, the User may allow third parties to use the
Freepik Content, when each and every of the following conditions are met:

The third party has professionally instructed the User to produce goods or
provide services to it/him/her and the User uses a limited number of items
within the Freepik Content to produce such goods or provide such services to
the instructing third party;
The authorization granted by the User to the third party is in writing and
complies with every restriction of the User’s authorization to use the
relevant Freepik Content and includes, without limitation, a restriction for
the third party to distribute, resell or license the relevant Freepik Content
(i.e. the third party is the final user of the relevant Freepik Content);
None of the contents in the Freepik Content which are subject to the
authorization are used as the main element (because of size, relevance or any
other cause; in case of doubt about whether the content is the main element, it
shall be deemed as the main element) in printed or electronic items (e.g.
t-shirts, cups, postcards, birthday or greeting cards, invitations, calendars,
web models or electronic devices, apps, NFTs, videogames, advertising spots,
audiovisual animations) aimed to be resold by the third party;
The production of goods or provision of services by the User to the third party
is not done by automatic means, it is tailor-made for the third party (and
therefore its use is not authorized by the User to any other third party) and
requires a specific substantial human intervention from the User in relation to
each third party; and
The User -and not the third party- chooses the specific items within the
Freepik Content to be used in the production of goods or provision of services
for the third party.
When all of the above conditions are met, the User shall be entitled to
authorize a third party to use the relevant Freepik Content. This exception
refers only to the prohibition for the User to authorize third parties to use
the Freepik Content without affecting or limiting in any way the remaining
conditions of the User’s right to use the Freepik Content. Whether the above
conditions regarding the exception to the prohibition for Users to authorize
third parties to use the Freepik Content are met shall be interpreted
restrictively so that, in case of doubt, it shall be deemed that the conditions
are not met.

The User does not acquire any right as a result of the use of the Freepik
Content. In particular, the User is not authorized to distribute, resell or
rent any Freepik Content (or any modification of any Freepik Content).

The Company may, at any time, offer any content on the Website under a
different license from the one included in this Section (the "Specific
License"). The Company will inform on the Website which content is licensed
under an Specific License. The Specific License will be made available to the
User and will include, without limitation, a description of the license itself,
as well as the permitted and prohibited uses in relation to the content. In the
event that a particular content is offered under a Specific License, the
Specific License shall apply over the general license described in this
Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all other obligations contained in
these Terms shall continue to be binding on the User, unless they conflict with
the Specific License, in which case the Specific License shall prevail.

The User’s rights under this Section will end automatically without any
notice if the User breaches any of the Terms. In case of termination of the
rights hereunder, the User shall cease using the Freepik Content and will
destroy every copy, whether total or partial, thereof.
